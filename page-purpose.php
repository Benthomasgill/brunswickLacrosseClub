                    <p><span class="sub-heading">Our History</span><br><br>Brunswick Lacrosse Club began as Moreland Lacrosse in 1994 by local residents of nearby Albert Street. It started as a junior team for children under 11 years by merging of teams from Moreland Primary School and Alphington Grammar School. <br><br>The club’s first game was at Fleming Park and as the club grew through the junior and senior grades it moved to Brearley Reserve and Clifton Park. The club returned home to Fleming Park, with a strong community energy in 2011. In 2020 the club has grown to 7 teams including women, men, girls and boys. Plans are in place by Moreland Council for upgrades to the clubhouse and change rooms in the near future.</p>
